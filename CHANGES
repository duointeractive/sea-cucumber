Sea Cucumber Change Log

1.5.1
=====

* Don't auto retry for clearly mal-formed addresses. (gtaylor)
* Use validate_email instead of deprecated email_re. (joshuakarjala)
* Add dkim signing support. (benburry)
* Add a custom SES AWS credential setting. (dmitry-mukhin)

1.5
===

* Correctly decode email bodies as UTF-8 before handing message off to
  the SendEmailTask that sends via boto. Fixes issues with UTF characters in
  email bodies resulting in errors.
* Minimum supported boto version is now 2.3 so we can make use of the more
  fine-grained SES exceptions.

1.4
===

* Take advantage of new SES exceptions in boto to prevent the re-trying of
  bounced or invalid email addresses.

1.3
===
* Assume default of 0 for current/prev day stats when no mails have been sent.
* Remove some code that didn't work for boto 2.1.

1.2
===
* Added support for rate limiting outbound emails per second, to make sure we're
  following SES's max email rate enforcement.
* Added the ses_usage management command. Shows usage and quota details.

1.1
===
* Fixed minor packaging issue.
* Small code re-org for the sake of organization.

1.0
===
* Initial release.
